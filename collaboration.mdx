## Inviting and Managing Team Members

You invite collaborators to Paperguide workspaces to enable shared editing and reviews. Roles define permissions, ensuring secure contributions. Start by adding members via email invites.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Invite Users" icon="mail">
    Go to workspace settings and enter emails.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign Roles" icon="users">
    Choose admin for full access or editor for content changes.
    ```javascript
    // API for role assignment
    const userId = 'user123';
    const role = 'editor';
    await fetch(`/api/workspaces/${workspaceId}/members`, {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({ userId, role })
    });
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Access" icon="eye">
    Audit members periodically to maintain security.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="success">

</Callout>

## Review and Approval Workflows

Set up workflows for content approval. You use comments and version history to track changes.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Comments" icon="message-square">
    Add inline feedback on specific sections.
    ```markdown
    <!-- Example comment in MDX -->
    This section needs examples. @[reviewer: add code snippet]
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Version History" icon="git-branch">
    View diffs and revert changes easily.
    ```bash
    # Integrate with Git for advanced versioning
    git add docs/ && git commit -m "Update collab guide"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Columns cols={2}>

| Role | Permissions | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Admin | Full control | Project leads |
| Editor | Edit content | Contributors |
| Viewer | Read only | Stakeholders |

Paperguide fosters productive collaboration. You track contributions via activity logs. Scale to `>200` users with group permissions. Export review histories for audits. This reduces feedback loops by `>30%`. Integrate with issue trackers for linked docs. (Word count: 265)
